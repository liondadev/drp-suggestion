# Reduce reliance on MaxNet / VentzCoin as a money making method, & give normal people WireMod permissions.

> ðŸ˜¦ sorry for the yapping throughout this, but this is something I feel strongly about...

I was working on a server with a few friends when CN DarkRP launched, and I ended the development of my stuff when DarkRP launched due to not believing I could compete with the resources of Civil Networks. I later joined DarkRP, had lots of fun, and decided to apply for Developer, which I eventually got accepted for. In that time, DarkRP basically died, and the times I got in I would be 1/2 or 1/1 player(s) online. This suggestion aims to improve on the biggest issue with DarkRP (in my opinion right now), the heavy reliance on VentzCoin for money making and MaxNet's role in most normal jobs.

## MaxNet is everywhere

MaxNet is everywhere on the server, including but not limited to:

1. VentzCoin
2. Gun Dealers
3. Buisness
4. Banking
5. Base Security
6. Ect...

MaxNet is incredibly advanced and convoluted, which causes newer players confusion. New players don't care about a wierd scripting language (MNScript), they just want to have fun and base. Unfortunately, MaxNet knowledge (and a pretty large amount of it) is required for VentzCoin, which is, itself, a very weird take on Bitcoin mining.

## VentzCoin is different for seemingly no reason

The Bitcoin system on most DarkRP servers is pretty simple:

1. Buy bitcoin rack
2. Buy bitcoin servers
3. Put upgrades if wanted
4. Start rack
5. Collect money later, usually profitable after 30 minutes or less

However, CN DarkRP's system is very different, and seems to be focused on realism (see the quote above I took from an unverified youtube short) instead of fun:

1. Go to an ingame website
1. Sign up for an account, and get a bitcoin token
1. Buy a MaxNet terminal
1. Buy a MaxNet monitor
1. Buy a bitcoin rack
1. Connect bitcoin rack to MaxNet terminal
1. Type fancy commands in a CLI-like terminal (really? why should new players need to do this??)
1. Wait for profit (last time I heard this takes like 2-3 hours - wtf??)

Not only is CN DarkRP's system more difficult, it ruins one of the primary reasons for raiding: short term gains. People raid in DarkRP for a large amount of money, while also accepting a large amount of risk. Unfortunately, VentzCoin removes this large amount of money incentive, but keeps the large amount of risk part. Due to how VentzCoin fundimentaly works, with money feeding into a VentzCoin account, there is simply no reason to raid people anymore. You could argue that the goal is to change their miners to mine for you, but this can only be done by hacking their miners. _Hacking MaxNet terminals is not something new players will do._

The few times I have successfully raided a base, there is nothing to do except take a few thousand from money printers. Especially from a new player's perspective, there is no reason to raid bases. No-one is going to wait around for Meth (or other money making methods) to finish cooking, people just want to raid, get _lots of_ money, and go.

## The suggestion

Everything before this is a background, this is the proper suggestion in formal suggestion format:

**What does this suggestion change/add/remove:**

- Rework VentzCoin to be more normal
  - Buy racks, connect them together somehow (maybe a VentzCoin controller or something), and collect money over time.
- Rework or remove MaxNet
  - This is pretty dificult to do entirely, but MaxNet needs to be heavily nerfed / reworked, or outright removed. The goal is player retention, and newer players won't stay if there's no way to make money. MaxNet powers most of the gun dealerships through auto-dealerships (I've only ever seen two gun dealerships, but I always find dealerships on the side of the road). MaxNet powers most of the big businesses, especially banks. The entire banking system runs on MaxNet ATMs. MaxNet needs to be reworked, nerfed, or removed.
- Give normal people WireMod
  - WireMod is pretty awesome, but barely any DarkRP servers support it anymore. Not only would WireMod support bring a niche audience of advanced wiremod users, it would also help compete against MaxNet, or even replace it if MaxNet was fully removed. The only way for good WireMod adoption is to give WireMod to normal peolple.
  - Wiremod is prone to lagging servers, maybe a playtime requirement of a day or something could stop minges. WireMod actions should be logged heavily (maybe even to staff-only or global chat?).
- Give missions through NPCs
  - This would replace the MaxNet BlackNet system, and players could find NPCs around the map with various hacking missions. (like hacking ATMs)
    - This could possibly also give extra hits to Hitmen, giving Hitmen something to do when no-one wants to place hits.
    - We could possibly use a very heavily forked version of CMissions...

**Has something similar been suggested before? If so, how is your suggestion different?:**
I did not see any suggestions similar to this after searching "maxnet" on the DarkRP suggestions forum.

**Possible positives of the suggestion (at least 2):**

- Removes or reworks a system that causes new players confusion
  - We need a constant feed of new players to keep playercount, this could help that
- WireMod allows for cooler, more elaborate builds
  - Cars (cant wait to see massive dick cars everywhere...)
  - Remove delivery systems (image remote ordering guns right to your base?)
  - Cool billboards
  - Lots of other cool stuff
- Adds more value to raiding
  - No-one raid for long-term money, people raid for short-term success. A simpler bitcoin system, like Blue's Bitcoin Mining or CB Bitcoin Mining, gives players more incentive to raid because there will literally be money waiting for them inside a Bitcoin Miner Rack (or whatever the new system uses).

**Possible Negatives of the suggestion:**

- MaxNet fans would not be happy if MaxNet was nerfed, especially people who paid for MaxNet scripts
- MaxNet is basically everywhere, this suggestion would takes LOTS of development time (from mainly Sr + Core developers) to fully implement.

**Based on the Positives and Negatives, why should this suggestion be implemented:**
Pros outweigh the cons, and clearly something isn't working right now, because, well.. <https://i.imgur.com/dOzjzF3.png>

I am a relatively new player to CIvil Networks, only 'joining' the community when DarkRP relaunched. I thought MaxNet was the coolest thing ever, but I eventually realized I didn't want to learn another programming language for a single DarkRP server that now averages 0 players. MaxNet and VCMiners have been roadblocks for me progressing more on the server, and I guarantee newer players feel the same way. This is definitely a long shot, because it would require lots of reworking and rewriting of core addons, but I think it's what's best for the server at large.
